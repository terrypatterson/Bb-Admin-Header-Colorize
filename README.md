# Bb-Admin-Header-Colorize
 Colorize the header in the Administrator Panel within Blackboard Learn

 With Blackboard's new Ultra navigation I found it difficult to tell in the Administrator Panel which environment I'm in. I've created some custom user CSS which gives me visual cues to let me know which instance I'm working in. :joy:

In the new style page, use the left area to provide a name for the style. I have used Blackboard Admin Headers in this example. Then click on **Import**.
